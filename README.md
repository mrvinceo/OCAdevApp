# OCAdevApp
An Ionic App that plugs into the student site.

# Current Functionality
Uses Drupal 7's Services module to expose Drupal nodes and views as Json, to be consumed by an Ionic-based App. Currently using Dev server.

# To address:
Need to deal with Authentication to make this useful to students/tutors - oAuth > Student Site via Gapps.
Image URL issue, app appears to be mis-interpretting the Image URLs.
